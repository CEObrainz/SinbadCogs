## Whats here?

Various addons for Red Discordbot. Most of these are focused around utility purposes.

I'll have a more in depth guide to my cogs put together at a later date.

## Contact

I'm Sinbad#0001 on Discord

Feel free to ask for help with these in [This Discord](https://discord.gg/mb85deu)

I'm also around in the main [Red Discord Server](https://discord.gg/red)


If you'd like to see additional features or find a bug, leave an issue

## Commissions

Most of the time, you'd be better off posting for a cog commission on the [dedicated site](https://cogboard.red/) for them. If you'd like to contact me specifically about comission work, you can contact me on discord. I may not respond immediately, but I will get back to you when I have the ability to do so.
