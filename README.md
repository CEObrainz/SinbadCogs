## What's with the slow development?

Discord has recently made several negative changes 
as well as removed their promises to users from their sites.

Many of the communities I was doing this for are considering other platforms, or have already left.
While I don't mind keeping the tools here available to other people,
it's hard to justify much of my own time on this right now.
